<h1>
  Basic I/O for OpenCV in Android Studio
</h1>
<p>
  This sample project is for using OpenCV in Android Studio on a camera stream. <br>
  The camera stream is converted into an HSV Mat to be processed.
  
  Unfortunately, this project is unable to output the HSV Mat to the screen.
  So, it is more like just a Basic I (Input).
